Double Down/Towers and Fields

Terminology:
Field - One of the 4 starting stacks of cards, begin the game with the top card face up.
Tower - One of 4 potential stacks you can build from cards in the fields. Only one per suit is allowed.

How to play:
The objective of the game is to clear each Field of all of its cards.
To do so you must match cards together in pairs of opposite colors and one greater rank.
ex. A 2 of Spades can be matched with a 3 of Hearts/Diamonds or a Ace of Hearts/Diamonds.
Aces are played low, but can also be matched with Kings.

In the event that you're not able to make any matches from the cards in the fields, you
can then build a tower. A tower is built by placing a card in one of the 4 free spaces
above the fields. You may only have one tower per suit and you can only place another card
on a tower if the new card's rank is lower than the current card. Pairs cannot be made between
towers, so the only way to remove a card from a tower is to match it was a card in the fields OR
you may place the top card from a tower onto an empty field if you have any.




Extra:
It is possible to end the game with cards leftover. I haven't decided what to do about those yet
and am open to ideas.
If you want to challenge someone to the same game you can play a seeded game by clicking on the 
"Game Seed" option on the main menu and entering a number or word.
